                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Welcome to my working portfolio. I'm currently a full stack web development stutent at the University of Texas - Austin Coding Bootcamp.
                    Below you'll find my past projects. I've taken introductory classes in Python, C++, and Swift as part of the App Development and Design program at Austin Community College.
                     I hope to continue learning these languages at Austin Community College as I grow my career. 
                </p>
                <p>In my free time I enjoy photography, hiking, and exploring the outdoors, and I hope to tie these hobbies into my developer knowledge
                    to create real world applications. 
                </p>

                <h2>Soccer Simulator</h2>
                <p>This was a small side project testing my Python knowledge while taking my first Python class. It was a fun deviation 
                    while working on class assignments to test my knowledge. It is essentially a random number generator that updates the score
                    of the game every 5 minutes with a slight home field advantage.

                <p>The client asked that their code be reviewed as well as improve the accessibility of their website to help improve
                    search engine optimization. </p>
